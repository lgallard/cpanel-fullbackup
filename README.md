# cpanel-fullbackup

This is a php script to perform the cPanel's full backup request  to make a backup locally, so you can get those backups from cPanel full-backup tool. It is a modification of Justin Cook's [Automatic cPanel backup (domain & MySQL)](http://www.justin-cook.com/wp/2006/12/27/automatic-cpanel-backup-domain-mysql-with-cron-php/) with cron & PHP . Due to I don't have a ftp server, I changed some lines to make the backup locally.
